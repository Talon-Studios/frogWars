## Debug Mode
To enter debug mode, uncomment ```debug: true``` in ```config.js```.

## Pull Requests
After I have approved your issue, you may create a pull request. I will review it and merge it. I have installed a Code Quality check, so **if one of the checks fail, I will not review the request.**
